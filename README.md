# cv2_WebGlass
Webglass was developed to provide a better "virtual try-on" solution for buying glasses online.
It was written as a seinor project for my undergraduate computing science degree. 
Looking back at the code i'm not very happy with the code style and the general disorganization of the file.
If I had drive to mainitan the project, I would rewrite it. 

# Installation
The projecy uses python3, which most operating systems have installed by default.

If this is not the case you can install it using:
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3
```
Next you will need to install numpy. As with python3 this may or may not be pre-intsalled on your OS.
If you already have numpy installed skip to installing OpenCv.

First you should install PIP
```
sudo apt-get install pip
```
Then you can install Numpy

```
pip install numpy
```

Lastly you will need to install OpenCV. Instructions can be found [here](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/03/27/how-to-install-dlib/).
# Running the project
Once you have the depenancies installed, clone the repo and run with
```
./main.py
```
